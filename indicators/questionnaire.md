# Maturity Assessment Questionnaire
This document provides a comprehensive self-assessment framework for open-source project owners, maintainers, and Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to gain a deep, evidence-based understanding of their project's maturity.

### How to Use This Questionnaire

This questionnaire is designed as a reflective tool to evaluate the project's current, demonstrable state. For each indicator across the seven pillars, the assessment involves a three-step process:

1. **Select the Maturity Level:** Choose the overall maturity level (LOW, MED, or HIGH) that most accurately describes the project's current practices for that indicator.
2. **Select Detailed Practices:** From the checklist provided under the chosen maturity level, select all applicable practices that justify the selection. This provides the specific evidence for the assessment.
3. **Provide Context and Evidence:** Use the free-form text box to add crucial context, links to public evidence (e.g., governance documents, security policies, public roadmaps), or explain any unique circumstances that influence the project's approach.


## Pillar 1: Governance

This pillar assesses the transparency, structure, and effectiveness of the project's decision-making processes and community management. Mature governance fosters trust, encourages broad contribution, and ensures the long-term strategic viability of the project.
